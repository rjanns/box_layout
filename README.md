## About

This is a modified version of 'Full Screen Layout Page Transistions' and boxlayout.js.

FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions
=========

This responsive layout is based on an initial grid of four boxes. Once a box is clicked, it gets resized to fullscreen and the other boxes scale down and fade out. In the work section we experiment with another transition which is to show a panel by making it appear from the bottom while scaling the current one down. To see it in action, open the work section and click on one of the portfolio items and navigate through them.
